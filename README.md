# CS 273 Project

Dataset: CIFAR 10
Due: Dec 13

Report: 4 pages long

Elements:

1. Data exploration.
2. Two ML techniques.
  - The design choices should be based on what we learned by exploring the data.
  - We should also mention the reasons why we chose those hyperparameters, e.g. to control complexity.
3. Feature design or model optimization.
  - Data augmentation?
4. Performance validation.
  - Cross validation, model selection, etc.
5. Summary of how we changed the models to prevent under- or over-fitting.
